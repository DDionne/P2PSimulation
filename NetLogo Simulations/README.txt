These Simulations are done in Netlogo, a program dedicated to building simulations.

- Learning-Peers-Simulation is a Peer-to-Peer Simulation which doesn't contain links. The Peers learn as time goes on
	utilising a utility function so that they have more success in finding what they are trying to find.

- RS-Simulation is basically a remake of the original DEVS P2PSimulation using a random surfer model as the peer and 
	using document-links in the network.

This simulation was made with 100 peers that began with a random distribution of documents and a random set of
friends.

This simulation ran for 3000 ticks and is supposed to mimic the peer-to-peer simulation done using the 
cd++ builder plugin for eclipse.



To create this simulation, turtles were used as peers, since they could be given there own instance variables.
each peer had it's own list of friends and it's own list of documents. To simulate connections, links were used.
Meaning when two peers connect, it can be seen in the window.

Every tick, the following happens:

goes through every peer in random order:

1- Checks whether the peer is online or not
2- If the peer is online, go to 3. If the peer is offline, hide it on the window and remove all connections
3- If nothing has been searched previously, then search for a random document
   -If a search was done and a document was published, then search for links from the last published
    document (publish a random link)

Currently peers stay online for a minimum of 180 ticks and a max of 360
peers stay offline for a minimum of 50 ticks and a max of 550 ticks

These values can be easily changed.

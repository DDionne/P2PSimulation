The zip file containing the Simulator is too big to be placed here. However, it can be downloaded off of github in the downloads directory of the P2PSimulation repository

for more information on how to set up and use the P2P Simulator, download and extract the P2PSimulation.zip into your eclipse workspace and view the README file there.
